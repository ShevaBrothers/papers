This is the source code for experiments from the paper:

===

         Hard Test Generation
for Augmenting Path Maximum Flow Algorithms
    using Genetic Algorithms: Revisited

===

Requirements:

This software requires Java 1.8 and recent Ant to be installed on the system.

Instructions:

ant random  - runs an experiment for random flow test generation and selecting
              the best.
ant genetic - runs an experiment for genetic test generation.
ant summary - constructs the summary files

The summary task depends on two previous ones.

All these tasks are very resource-consuming, "summary" being the cheapest one
(about 10 minutes). Tasks "random" and "genetic" support multi-processor
systems and will automatically use all available processors.

Experiments don't recompute runs that are already computed.
One can download the generated results as a single archive file at

http://genome.ifmo.ru/files/papers_files/CEC2015/flow-tests-5e5.tar.xz
        (117 907 704 bytes, ~450 megabytes unpacked)

and replace the "flows/tests" directory by the contents of this archive.
After that, running "ant summary" will just build the summary tables but
will not recompute the experiments.
