This is the source code for experiments from the paper:

===

Runtime Analysis of (1+1) Evolutionary Algorithm
Controlled with Q-learning using Greedy Exploration Strategy
on OneMax+ZeroMax Problem

===

Instructions:

Run "./run.sh" to get the experiment results in a plain text format.

Run "./run.sh --latex" to get them as a LaTeX table.

The experiment results are cached in "logs" directory.
The logs used in the paper are already there.
To recompute, remove the "logs" directory and rerun "./run.sh".

Contents:

README                  - this file.
run.sh                  - a bash script to run experiments.
OnePlusOneModel.java    - the one and only source file.
logs                    - the directory which stores the cached experiment results.
